    "I began by looking at 2012, 2017 national data from the Census bureau. I looked at breakdowns by Sex and Age.

I also double checked by calculation of un-insurance rates with the Kaiser Family Foundation data base, arriving at the same results. Finally, I used KFF's database to look at Medicaid expansion in this timeframe."
